## Introduction

Huffman coding is a popular algorithm used for lossless data compression. It works by assigning variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters. This allows for efficient compression of text files, reducing their size while preserving all of the original information.

## Features

- Compress text files using Huffman coding.
- Decompress Huffman-encoded files to retrieve the original text.
